## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to improving my understanding of **Data Structures** and **Algorithms** in **Java**. It contains solutions to common DSA problems and concept explanations, with clean, simple code examples.

Check out the repository here: [DSA-Java](https://github.com/faij1207/DSA-Java.git).

## Data Structures

### Some of the data structures covered:
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees)
- Heaps
- Graphs
- Hash Tables

Each topic will be organized in its own folder for easy navigation.

## Algorithms

### Some algorithms implemented include:
- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search)
- Dynamic Programming
- Graph Traversal (DFS, BFS)
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Greedy Algorithms

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/faij1207/DSA-Java.git
